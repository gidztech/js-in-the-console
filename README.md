# JavaScript in the Console
I like to play around with JavaScript in the Console. I think it is one of the best ways to learn how JavaScript works. You can just try things out and see results quickly. If it's not obvious after a little play, you can look it up. At this point you have more context to be able to ask the right questions, but also you skip a bunch of reading. It is a more productive technique than reading a bunch of APIs and tutorials because you get a more hands on experience.

I have decided to start sharing some of my discoveries while playing with the Chrome DevTools Console. I have added examples and explanations in the form of short paragraphs and comments in the code. It should be simple for you to copy and paste and run it yourself. You will probably discover even more than what I show here.

I recommend the [Snippets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/snippets/?hl=en) feature of Chrome DevTools. It allows you to run a whole batch of code into the Console, which can be saved and re-run at a later date. It saves you having to use the shift key for carriage returns and also allows for easier indentation.
